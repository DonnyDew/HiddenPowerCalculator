Pokémon Hidden Power Calculator:

In Pokémon there is a move called "Hidden Power" and the type is determined by the amount 
of IV's a Pokémon has. Using all 6 IV's you can calculate what type of move it will be 
using a formula.

This project allows the user to enter the IV's using sliders and produces what type of 
move hidden power will be. 

I used the Java Swing Library to create the GUI
